# Destrega static recompilation — agent guide

PS1 *Destrega* (Koei 1998, NTSC-U `SLUS_007.32`) statically recompiled from
MIPS R3000 to C, linked against a native PS1 hardware runtime (C11 + SDL3).
Analysis is done with REA (Ghidra provider). The game boots, plays its FMV,
reaches the title screen, and is playable (1P battle, practice, story, VS).

## Read these first

1. `recomp/recomp.py` — driver: inputs, seeds, overlays, outputs.
2. `recomp/analyze.py` — flow tracing, jump tables, delay-slot handling.
3. `recomp/codegen.py` — exactly what C each MIPS instruction becomes.
4. `runtime/psx.h`, `runtime/recomp.h` — the contract between generated code and runtime.
5. `runtime/rt.c` (dispatch, interrupts), `runtime/bios.c` (kernel HLE), `runtime/bus.c` (memory map, DMA, timers, scheduler).

## Pipeline (real commands)

```sh
python3 tools/extract_disc.py Destrega/Destrega.bin disc   # ISO9660 -> disc/ (needed by recomp)
python3 tools/psxexe2elf.py disc/SLUS_007.32 build/elf/SLUS_007.32.elf   # for REA/Ghidra
./tools/rea_export_overlays.sh                             # REA procedure lists for overlays (slow, cached)
python3 recomp/recomp.py                                   # -> gen/*.c (≈1 s); CMake also runs this
cmake -S . -B build/cmake -G Ninja && cmake --build build/cmake -j10
./build/cmake/destrega                                     # play from the data pack (first launch imports)
./build/cmake/destrega --import Destrega/Destrega.cue      # CLI import -> data pack
tools/run_tests.sh                                         # verification (see below)
```

The main-exe REA export is `analysis/rea_list_procedures_main.json` (MCP
`list_procedures`); a reusable REA snapshot is `analysis/SLUS_007.32.rea-snapshot`
(`open_binary` with `snapshot_path`). REA's Ghidra MIPS lane only admits
ELF `e_flags = EF_MIPS_ARCH_32` with **no ABI bits** — `psxexe2elf.py` writes
`0x50000000`. The REA CLI needs `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR`/`JAVA_HOME` (see the script).

## Game data (bring your own disc, Ship of Harkinian-style)

`runtime/disc.c` is the only code that touches game data. Sources: a raw
MODE2/2352 `.bin`, a `.cue`, or the data pack `destrega.pak` written by
`disc_import()` (zlib blocks of 16 raw sectors + offset table; every sector of
the disc, byte-exact). The import verifies `SLUS_007.32` (641024 bytes,
CRC-32 57818cb0 = US SLUS-00732). Default pack location is SDL's pref path
(`~/Library/Application Support/Destrega/`); override with `--data-dir`.
A positional path argument runs directly from that image/pack (dev use).
`tools/extract_disc.py` reads both .bin and .pak.

## Boot path

`runtime/main.c` opens the pack (or the given image), `disc_verify()`,
`disc_load_file("SLUS_007.32")` via ISO9660,
copies text to `0x800244d0`, sets `sp=0x801fff00` (SYSTEM.CNF), `SR=0x40000401`,
`bios_init()` (kernel tables at 0x200/0x674/0x874 → HLE trampolines at 0x3000),
then `rt_call(0x800a44e8)` (Psy-Q crt0 → `main` at `0x8002b80c`). Everything
else is driven from the game's own loop; the frontend runs inside the VBlank
scheduler event (`frontend_vblank`: present, input, audio, 60 Hz pacing).

## Code model

- One C function per MIPS function: `f_<addr>` (main), `f_<addr>_<OVL>` (overlays).
  Registers live in `g_cpu`; delay slots are executed before the branch takes
  effect; branch conditions / jump targets are captured first.
- Direct calls within an image (and overlay→main) are C calls; everything else
  goes through `rt_call` (binary search of `g_recomp_table`). Overlay entries are
  verified against RAM with an FNV-1a hash of the function's original bytes.
- Unknown targets fall back to `interp_run` (MIPS interpreter) which re-enters
  native code at the first recompiled entry. A `dispatch: no recompiled function`
  log line means a missing seed: add it to `analysis/extra_seeds.txt`
  (`<hex> [OVLNAME]`) or improve seeding in `recomp.py`.
- Cycle accounting: `CYC(n)` (2 cycles/insn), `EVT_CHECK()` at function entry and
  backward branches runs `rt_event()` → scheduler + IRQ delivery.

## Overlays (from REA decompilation of FUN_8004c1e8 / FUN_8003e36c / FUN_8006b35c)

Files are `memcpy`'d verbatim (4-byte header, code at +4) into
P1 slot `0x80010000` (`Mxxx.BIN`, `EVENT_SP.BIN`, `OPTOVL.BIN`) or
P2 slot `0x8001a268` (`Mxxx2.BIN`, `EVENTOVL.BIN`). See `recomp/overlays.py`.

## Interrupts / BIOS (non-obvious)

- libetc's `ResetCallback` (0x8009b8bc) `setjmp`s into a buffer at 0x800be224 and
  passes it to `HookEntryInt`. On an IRQ, `rt.c:take_interrupt` saves the CPU,
  runs SysEnqIntRP chains (libpad's VBlank handler), loads the hook buffer and
  resumes at its `ra` **through the interpreter** (mid-function address); the
  dispatcher at 0x8009b994 ends in `ReturnFromException` = C `longjmp` back.
- Pads: libpad drives **SIO0 directly** (`runtime/sio.c`), not BIOS InitPAD.
- CD: libcd at register level (`runtime/cdrom.c`); BIOS leaves CD int-enable = 0x1f.
  XA audio + STR video (5 movies, file channel 1) live in `XADATA.BNS`.
- Memory card: reported as **absent** (no saves yet).

## Verification

`tools/run_tests.sh`: GTE/GPU/SPU/MDEC unit tests + a headless smoke test that
boots to a fight via scripted input and fails on FATAL / dispatch misses /
unhandled BIOS calls / black screen. Useful headless flags:
`--headless --frames N --dump DIR --dump-every N --press F:MASK,... --wav out.wav --trace`.
Button mask bits (active high in `--press`): Select 0x1, Start 0x8, Up 0x10,
Right 0x20, Down 0x40, Left 0x80, L2 0x100, R2 0x200, L1 0x400, R1 0x800,
Triangle 0x1000, Circle 0x2000, Cross 0x4000, Square 0x8000.
`python3 tools/contact_sheet.py out.png frames...` tiles screenshots for review.
Headless runs ~200x real time (30k frames ≈ 13 s).

## Pitfalls

- Branches may target another branch's delay slot (e.g. 0x800951c0); the tracer
  must not treat delay slots as visited flow positions.
- Jump-table bases are often loaded into a saved register far from the `jr`
  (`Analyzer.const_of` whole-function fallback).
- `.text` contains data on both sides of code (0x800244d0–0x80026618 and
  ≥0x800aa000): never linear-sweep; only trace from seeds.
- Interrupt delivery restores the whole `g_cpu` — keep `cycles`/`next_event`
  and the shadow call stack depth (`g_depth`) from *after* the handler.
- `gen/` is generated; never edit it by hand.
- DMA completion races (fixed in `bus.c`; symptom: KOEI splash / intro FMV
  lagging, stuck in the STR wait loop at 0x80049e90): libcd's CD interrupt
  handler read-modify-writes DICR, which acked an MDEC slice-done flag that
  became set in between, killing libpress's slice->callback chain. Fixes:
  per-channel completion times, completions deferred while an interrupt
  handler runs, queued (not merged) repeat completions, and writes with the
  read-only bit 31 set are treated as RMW (no flag ack). Check with
  `--trace` (prints per-second MDEC frame/CD sector counts; intro = 15 fps).
- Fights run at 30 updates/s by design (`f_80027218(1)` -> `VSync(2)`); not a bug.
